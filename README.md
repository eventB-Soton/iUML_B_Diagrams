# iUML-B Diagrams
This feature provides generic infrastructure support for UML-B diagram plugins.
It provides a UML-B component resource (including Navigator functions) for containing diagrams, as well as
abstract meta-classes used in specific diagrams, adapters, property sheets and diagram provider for opening
 a diagram from the navigator.
This is just a basis; you should also install the specific diagram types you need.
